  <b>Missing JDBC driver</b><br>
  Pythia needs JDBC drivers to connect to the Oracle database. There isn't neither such a driver in the class path nor at a place defined by you.<br>
  Oracle keeps these driver under a licence that does not allow to include them within Pythia. Because of this, you have to download the driver from Oracle (<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index-091264.html">last seen here</a>) and direct Pythia the path to the downloaded file. Therefore press the button Load JDBC Driver, select the file within the file selection dialog and press OK.<br>
