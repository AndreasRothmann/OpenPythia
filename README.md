# OpenPythia for Oracle databases [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/OpenPythia/OpenPythia.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/OpenPythia/OpenPythia)



- Your application seems to be slow?
- Your database has a high load?
- You do not know what the database is doing?

Take a non-invasive look inside the Oracle database and find out what it is doing, looking at the used CPU, used IO and the statements performed.

* Find bottlenecks in your Oracle database by analyzing table accesses.
* Get hints how to adjust the schema and SQL-statements to improve performance.
* Collect results in an Excel-file and get advice by experts without giving access to your database.
